Do not forget to open the Developer panel and see the section `Console`.

##Day 1: Arithmetic Operators

**Task**:

Complete the following functions in the editor below:

* getArea(length, width): Calculate and return the area of a rectangle having sides `length` and `width`.
* getPerimeter(length, width): Calculate and return the perimeter of a rectangle having `length` and `width`.

The values returned by these functions are printed to stdout by locked stub code in the editor.


**Solution**:

In `js/arithmetic-operators.js`.

##Day 1: Functions

**Task**:

Implement a function named factorial that has one parameter: an integer, `n`. 
It must return the value of `n!` (i.e., `n` factorial).

**Solution**:

In `js/functions.js`.

##Day 1: Let and Const

**Task**:

1. Declare a constant variable,`PI`, and assign it the value Math.PI. You will not pass this challenge unless the variable is declared as a constant and named PI (uppercase).
2. Read a number,`r`, denoting the radius of a circle from stdin.
3. Use `PI` and `r` to calculate the `area` and `perimeter` of a circle having radius `r`.
4. Print `area` as the first line of output and print `perimeter` as the second line of output.


**Solution**:

In `js/let-and-const.js`.
