##Day 5: Inheritance

**Task**:

We provide the implementation for a Rectangle class in the editor. Perform the following tasks:

1. Add an area method to Rectangle's prototype.
2. Create a Square class that satisfies the following:
    * It is a subclass of Rectangle.
    * It contains a constructor and no other methods.
    * It can use the Rectangle class' area method to print the area of a Square object.

Locked code in the editor tests the class and method implementations and prints the area values to `STDOUT`.

**Solution**:

In `js/inheritance.js`.
