## Day 6: Bitwise Operators

**Task**:

We define `S` to be a sequence of distinct sequential integers from `1` to `n` ; in other words, `S = {1, 2, 3, ..., n}`.
We want to know the maximum bitwise AND value of any two integers, `a` and `b` (where `a < b`), in sequence `S` 
that is also less than a given integer, `k`.

Complete the function in the editor so that given `n` and `k`, it returns the maximum `a & b < k`.

**Solution**:

In `js/bitwise-operators.js`.

## Day 6: JavaScript Dates

**Task**:

Given a date string, `dateString`, in the format `MM/DD/YYYY`, find and return the day name for that date.
Each day name must be one of the following strings: `Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, or Saturday`.
For example, the day name for the date `12/07/2016` is `Wednesday`.

**Solution**:

In `js/dates.js`.
