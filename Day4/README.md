## Day 4: Create a Rectangle Object

**Task**:

Complete the function in the editor. It has two parameters: `a` and `b`. It must return an object modeling a rectangle
that has the following properties:

* `length`: This value is equal to `a`.
* `width`: This value is equal to `b`.
* `perimeter`: This value is equal to `2 * (a + b)`.
* `area`: This value is equal to `a * b`.

**Solution**:

In `js/rectangle-object.js`.

## Day 4: Count Objects

**Task**:

Complete the function in the editor. It has one parameter: an array, `a`, of objects. Each object in the array
has two integer properties denoted by `x` and `y`. The function must return a count of all such objects `o` in array `a`
that satisfy `o.x == o.y`.

**Solution**:

In `js/count-objects.js`.

## Day 4: Classes

**Task**:

Create a `Polygon` class that has the following properties:

* A constructor that takes an array of integer values describing the lengths of the polygon's sides.
* A `perimeter()` method that returns the polygon's perimeter.

Locked code in the editor tests the Polygon constructor and the perimeter method. 

**Solution**:

In `js/classes.js`.
