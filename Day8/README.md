##Day 8: Create a Button

**Task**:

Complete the code in the editor so that it creates a clickable button satisfying the following properties:

* The button's `id` is btn.
* The button's initial text label is `0`. After each click, the button must increment by `1`. Recall that the button's 
  text label is the JS object's `innerHTML` property.
* The button has the following style properties:
    * A `width` of `96px`.
    * A `height` of `48px`.
    * The `font-size` attribute is `24px`.

The `.js` and `.css` files are in different directories, so use the link tag to provide the CSS file path and the script
tag to provide the JS file path:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/button.css" type="text/css">
    </head>
    
    <body>
    	<script src="js/button.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

**Solution**:

In `index.html` and `js/button.js`.
