##Day 3: Try, Catch, and Finally

**Task**:

Complete the reverseString function; it has one parameter, `s`. You must perform the following actions:

1. Try to reverse string using the split, reverse, and join methods.
2. If an exception is thrown, catch it and print the contents of the exception's `message` on a new line.
3. Print `s` on a new line. If no exception was thrown, then this should be the reversed string; 
if an exception was thrown, this should be the original string.

**Solution**:
