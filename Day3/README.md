##Day 3: Arrays


**Task**:

Complete the `getSecondLargest` function in the editor below. It has one parameter: an array, `nums`, of numbers.
The function must find and return the second largest number in `nums`.

**Solution**:

In `js/arrays.js`.

##Day 3: Try, Catch, and Finally

**Task**:

Complete the reverseString function; it has one parameter, `s`. You must perform the following actions:

1. Try to reverse string using the split, reverse, and join methods.
2. If an exception is thrown, catch it and print the contents of the exception's `message` on a new line.
3. Print `s` on a new line. If no exception was thrown, then this should be the reversed string; 
if an exception was thrown, this should be the original string.

**Solution**:

In `js/try-catch.js`.

##Day 3: Throw

**Task**:

Complete the isPositive function below. It has one integer parameter, `a`. If the value of `a` is positive, it must
return the string `YES`. Otherwise, it must throw an Error according to the following rules:

* If `a` is `0`, throw an Error with `= Zero Error`.
* If `a` is negative, throw an Error with `= Negative Error`.

**Solution**:

In `js/throw.js`.
